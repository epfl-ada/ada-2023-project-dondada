# IPocalypse now: how IPAs invaded our pints

## Abstract: Anyone enjoying a beer from time to time has noticed it, IPAs are now on every bar's tap and can't be avoided. But how did this happen ? From where and at what speed did this trend spread ? Is the IPA really the most popular type of beer ? Is there region of the world that have not been invaded yet ? In the following project we will try to answer
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. Whatâ€™s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?



## Research Questions:

From where did the trend spread ? Is there a particular country at the root of the tree ? 
Is there region of the world that have not been invaded yet ? 
Is the IPA really the most popular type of beer ?  
Can a brewery succeed if it has no IPAs in its cave ? 







## Proposed additional datasets (if any):
If we look at raw data we can see that the USA is from far the country which rates the most beer, however is the country with the most ratings per capita ? To answer such questions, we will need to have at our disposal data about the population of each country. Therefore we will use a dataset such as this one ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset ) to bring some data to a "per capita" ratio.

## Methods
\textbf{Metrics we will use to define a beer type popularity:}
The number of ratings for that type (even though this does not show if a beer is appreciated, it allows to see if it's drinked a lot)
The average grade and the average bros_score (the bros_score being a the score given by an expert)
The number of fans of this type of beer (We will define a fan as a user who has at least 90\% of his reviews dedicated to the beer of interest \textcolor{red}{and maybe who always gives a good grade}
## Proposed timeline

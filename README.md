# IPocalypse now: how IPAs invaded our pints

## Abstract: 
We can trace back first occurences of the word IPA as far back as the $`19^{th}`$ century. However it seems that it is only in the past decades that IPAs became popular, at the point that now, one cannot sit in a bar without seeing this word on every beer tap. But how did this happen ? In this project, we will try to identify how the IPA trend spread throughout the world both from a geographical and social point of view. To do so we will analyse millions of review from two beer rating websites [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/) and [RateBeer](https://www.ratebeer.com/). Ultimately, we would like to understand what are the key factors necessary for a beer style to spread at a global scale, identify what beer type will replace the IPA in the heart of beer lovers and from where it will emerge.

A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. Whatâ€™s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

## Research Questions:

Geographical point of view:
- From where and when did the trend spread ?
- Is there a particular country at the root of the tree ?
- Is there region of the world that have not been invaded yet ? 

Social point of view:
- Is the IPA really the most popular type of beer ?
- Can we link the microbreweries & craft beer trend to the IPA trend ?
- Can a brewery succeed if it has no IPAs in its cave ?

Can we identify the next hyped beer type and where it will emerge ?

## Proposed additional datasets:
If we look at raw data from beer rating datasets, we can see that the USA is from far the country which rates the most beer, however is the country with the most ratings per capita ? To answer such questions, we will need to have at our disposal data about the population of each country. Therefore we will use a dataset such as the [world population dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset) to bring some data to a "per capita" ratio.

## Methods:
**Metrics we will use to define a beer type popularity:**
- The number of ratings for that type (even though this does not show if a beer is appreciated, it allows to see if it's drinked a lot)
- The average grade and the average bros_score (the bros_score being a the score given by an expert)
- The number of fans of this type of beer (We will define a fan as a user who has at least 90\% of his reviews dedicated to the beer of interest $\textcolor{red}{and maybe who always gives a good grade}$
- Words that are often mentionned in reviews. First we will identify words describing a "good" beer by obtaining the words that are the most represented in positive reviews of beers graded 4.0 or more. Then we will see if these words also appear often for a given type of beer, if we find a match, it may suggest that this beer type is highly appreciated !
